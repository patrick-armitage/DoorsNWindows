      %h4 We guarantee our quality and services to all customers
    :markdown
      Our assurance to our customers- we are persuaded to do things
      correctly and we stand behind our installations. By law we are
      required to give a one-year warranty on our installations, but
      we automatically give a five-year warranty. We do offer extended
      warranties with our service plan for an additional fee. The
      service plan we offer is, every four months we will do a product
      checkup and cleaning which will keep your product in mint
      condition. If products are not serviced, your warranties can
      potentially be void. So whether you have our service plan or not,
      you should upkeep your product so warranties are not voided.
